# LiCAS_ECI_UDP
LiCAS External Control Interface (ECI) through UDP sockets. This package developed in C++ is used to send control references to and receive state feedback from the control program of the LiCAS dual arm.

The LiCAS Robotic Arms (Lightweight and Compliant Anthropomorphic Dual Arm Systems) are intended to operate on high altitude workspaces or in remote areas, executing the control program in an onboard computer accessed through SSH session.
